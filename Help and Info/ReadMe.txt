READ ME:
All applications (Menu, Ride The Bus, Screw The Dealer, and Higher Or Lower)
were created by Conor Phan. 

The GUI was manually made without the help of QTDesigner. 
Each app is fully playable.
All three games are based off card games that go by the same name.

MENU GUIDE:
The menu has three playable games.
To play a game, click on the desired game name.
This will be either Higher Or Lower, Screw the Dealer, or Ride the Bus.

For details on how to play each game, click on the desired game then go

be played. 

In each game click Menu then Back to Menu to come back to the main menu. 


HOW TO PLAY HIGHER OR LOWER:
Higher Or Lower is a game where you guess if the next card is higher or lower.
The goal of the game is to have a long consecutive number of correct guesses.

Aces are high

The card to the left of the up and down arrows
      is the card your comparing the next card to.

If you think the next card will be higher, press the up button
If you think the next card will be lower, press the down button

Aces are high.

After pressing a button, the card will move to the right of the 
	up and down arrows.
The next card will be placed to the left of the up and down arrows.
The card to the left of the arrows will then be compared to the 
	card on the right of the arrows.

If you chose higher and the next card was higher, your score will increase
	by 1.
If you chose lower and the next card was lower, your score will increase by 1.
If you chose higher and the next card was lower, your score will reset to 0.
If you chose lower and the next card was higher, your score will reset to 0.
If the next card is equal to the previous card your score will not change
	and it will be counted as if nothing happened.

The new card to the left of the arrows is now the card you are comparing
      to the next card.

Keep playing for as long as you want to. 
On the deck it says how many cards are left. 
When the deck hits 0, the deck will be shuffled, but your current 
	score will stay.

In the top right is your highscore, this shows your most consecutive
	choices in a row for this application run.

On the bottom is the previous 5 cards, which you could reference 
	for your next pick.

HOW TO PLAY RIDE THE BUS:
Ride the Bus uses a full deck of cards using all 4 suits, two of which
	are red and two of which are black.

Aces are High.

Ride The Bus is a fun game about semi-guessing four card related questions.
The goal of the game is to answer all 4 questions correctly.


FIRST QUESTION:
The first "question" is: will the next card be red or black.
You either click the red or black card.
Click the red card if you think the next card will be red.
Click the black card if you think the next card will be black.

The card will then be revealed to the top left card slot.
If you picked the correct color the game will move on to the second question.
If you picked the wrong suit, the game will say "You Lose" and the cards
	will reset.



SECOND QUESTION:
The second "question" is: will the next card be higher or lower than the
	first card.
If you believe the next card will be higher than the first card then click the
	up arrow.
If you believe the next card will be lower than the first card then click the
	down arrow.

Remember Aces are High.
The card will be revealed to the top right card slot.

If you clicked the up arrow and the next card is higher, the game will move on
	to the third question.
If you clicked the down arrow and the next card is lower, the game will move on
	to the third question.
If you clicked the up arrow and the next card is the same value or lower, the
	game will say "You Lose" and the cards will reset. You will go back 
	to question 1.
If you clicked the down arrow and the next card is the same value or higher,
	the game will say "You Lose" and the cards will reset. You will go back
	to question 1.



THIRD QUESTION:
The third "question" is: will the next card's value be in between or outside
	the two current cards already revealed. 
	An example of in between would be 5 is in between 3 and 8.
	An example of outside would be 5 is outside of 7 and Jack.

If you believe the next card's value is in between the two current card's 
	values then select "In Between".
If you believe the next card's value is outside the two current card's values
	then select "Outside".

The third card will be revealed in the bottom left slot.

If you clicked "In Between" and the next card's value was in between the other
	two card's values, the game will move on to question 4.
If you clicked "Outside" and the next card's value was outside the other
	two card's values, the game will move on to question 4.
If you clicked "In Between" and the next card's value was outside the other
	two card's values, the game will say "You Lose" and the cards will
	reset. You will go back to question 1.
If you clicked "Outside" and the next card's value was inside the other
	two card's values, the game will say "You Lose" and the cards will
	reset. You will go back to question 1.
If the card's value is the same as one of the other two card's value, the
	game will say "You Lose" and the cards will reset. You will go back
	to question 1.



FOURTH QUESTION:
The fourth "question" is: what suit will the next card be.
There are four suits in a deck of cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades).

Select out of the four options what you believe the next suit will be

The fourth card will be revealed at the bottom right slot.

If the suit you selected corresponds with the suit of the fourth card,
	you WIN THE GAME. The game will show a victory screen.

If the suit you selected does not correspond with the suit of the fourth card,
	the game will say "You Lose" and the cards will reset. You will go back
	to question 1.

The deck will automatically shuffle when there are 4 or less cards left in
	the deck.

HOW TO PLAY SCREW THE DEALER:
The goal of Screw the Dealer is to guess one of the three dealer's cards. 
If you guess it then you win the game, if not then the dealer wins.

Aces are High.

The game uses the common deck, with 52 cards and 4 suits.

The first thing you do is select a card.
To choose a card pick any of the 13 cards displayed in the middle of the 
	application. All the cards are the suit of Spade, but the suit has
	no relevance in this game. 
	An example of this would be to select the 7 of Spades.

The "Dealer" will then tell you if the hidden card is "Higher" or "Lower" than
	the card you selected.

You then get to make a second guess using the information the dealer has
	given you.
You make the second guess the same way you made the first by selecting a card.

If you selected the wrong card the game will reveal the card and then tell you
	how many numbers you were off of the dealer's card.

If you selected the right card on either guess it will show up in its
	corresponding spot. Your record will then appaer in the box.
	
The record displays as "Number of Wins/ Number Of Games"
An example of this would be "2/4". This would mean I played 4 games and won 2.

You have three attempts to "screw" the dealer. Each one being the same process
	of guessing a card, then the dealer telling you if its higher or lower.

Once the dealer has won or you have won, select a new card to start a new
	round.

On the bottom it will show all previous cards the dealer has had. This will
	help you make better choices when selecting a card.

Once the deck has 3 or less cards the deck will automatically shuffle and
	the cards at the bottom will be placed back into the deck.
