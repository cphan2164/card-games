HOW TO PLAY SCREW THE DEALER:
The goal of Screw the Dealer is to guess one of the three dealer's cards. 
If you guess it then you win the game, if not then the dealer wins.

Aces are High.

The game uses the common deck, with 52 cards and 4 suits.

The first thing you do is select a card.
To choose a card pick any of the 13 cards displayed in the middle of the 
	application. All the cards are the suit of Spade, but the suit has
	no relevance in this game. 
	An example of this would be to select the 7 of Spades.

The "Dealer" will then tell you if the hidden card is "Higher" or "Lower" than
	the card you selected.

You then get to make a second guess using the information the dealer has
	given you.
You make the second guess the same way you made the first by selecting a card.

If you selected the wrong card the game will reveal the card and then tell you
	how many numbers you were off of the dealer's card.

If you selected the right card on either guess it will show up in its
	corresponding spot. Your record will then appaer in the box.
	
The record displays as "Number of Wins/ Number Of Games"
An example of this would be "2/4". This would mean I played 4 games and won 2.

You have three attempts to "screw" the dealer. Each one being the same process
	of guessing a card, then the dealer telling you if its higher or lower.

Once the dealer has won or you have won, select a new card to start a new
	round.

On the bottom it will show all previous cards the dealer has had. This will
	help you make better choices when selecting a card.

Once the deck has 3 or less cards the deck will automatically shuffle and
	the cards at the bottom will be placed back into the deck.





Enjoy. Remember Aces are High.
