HOW TO PLAY HIGHER OR LOWER:
Higher Or Lower is a game where you guess if the next card is higher or lower.
The goal of the game is to have a long consecutive number of correct guesses.

Aces are high

The card to the left of the up and down arrows
      is the card your comparing the next card to.

If you think the next card will be higher, press the up button
If you think the next card will be lower, press the down button

Aces are high.

After pressing a button, the card will move to the right of the 
	up and down arrows.
The next card will be placed to the left of the up and down arrows.
The card to the left of the arrows will then be compared to the 
	card on the right of the arrows.

If you chose higher and the next card was higher, your score will increase
	by 1.
If you chose lower and the next card was lower, your score will increase by 1.
If you chose higher and the next card was lower, your score will reset to 0.
If you chose lower and the next card was higher, your score will reset to 0.
If the next card is equal to the previous card your score will not change
	and it will be counted as if nothing happened.

The new card to the left of the arrows is now the card you are comparing
      to the next card.

Keep playing for as long as you want to. 
On the deck it says how many cards are left. 
When the deck hits 0, the deck will be shuffled, but your current 
	score will stay.

In the top right is your highscore, this shows your most consecutive
	choices in a row for this application run.

On the bottom is the previous 5 cards, which you could reference 
	for your next pick.
